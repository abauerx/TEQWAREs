Hello There!

This is the TEQWARE Wizard repository! Here I host addons, repositories, and APK files that I have made or modified for Kodi, or people have requested for. Each addon probably has it's own repository, and this just serves as a collection of the packages.

<b>Usage</b>

Simply download the repository zip, and from within Kodi, go to System, Settings, Add-ons, Install from ZIP, and Kodi will do the rest!

<b>Questions, Comments, Concerns, Issues</b>

If you have any of these, go ahead and submit an issue, or contact me directly. I would prefer you submit an issue, though.
